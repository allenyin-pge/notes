Expectations:
- 1 month: Learning, tools, etc.
- 3 month
- 6 month
- 1 year
- Recurring meeting and scheduling


Plans:
- 1 month
- 3 month
- 6 month
- 1 year


Problems:
- Clean up ILI data


What are the ultimate goals?
- Use new model instead of the old risk model
- Want time and finanical component for the model
- At least get a calibrated model..
- Prove to stake-holders to gain trust in the model
   - What do they need to change the model?


To learn:
- Domain knowledge (read ASME book):
  - Different types of corrosion and threats
  - Mechanism of corrosion
- SOTA on threat modeling (read the PHMSA doc, pipeline risk modeling)
- Data pipeline:
  - Types of data available (structured, unstructured, continuous vs. discrete, time series)
  - How was each type of data collected (procedure, temporal cadence)
  - Data integration -- ARCGIS tool <-- learn that
- Data evaluation: How to evaluate if a model is doing well?
   - Compare against current model on risk scores
- Model production/deployment: Can we automate it?

---------------------------------

Different types of threat models, what to do with each?
- Transmission pipe = higher gas (our thing)
- Incident per mile (composite of all different threat models)
  - Right now in percentage (1 in 10,000 years) and likelihood of failures
  - Makes more sense to use dollar amount, and quantify mitigation cost

Other notes:
- Matters what category it is, because mitigation method matters depending on the type
- "Top side dents" -- may not always be third-party damage. Different confidence should
  be assigned to damage measurement.
  - For TPD: Usually a binary label, can have minimum threshold
  - 90% evaluation done by this -- in 7 year assessment, not all regions' assessment
    taken at the same time.
- Damage evaluation is consistent among evaluators
- Assessment methods:
  - picking/sending something through the pipelines,
  - strain test,
  - ICDA probe through surface about every ft (passing charges)

Digging up the pipes is very expensive
- Can use number of digging over time? Can use that as a proxy for mitigation effectivness
- Other indirect ways of measuring damages


PHMSA: Gas regulator, "mandated" the use of quantitative model



# TODO Backlog

## 7/18/2023: Sensitivity analysis:

Sensitivity analysis on what variables/data sources affect the model output?

Goal -- to inform future data collection project decisions.


## 9/5/2023: Corrosion engineering team:

Ian Brought up additional data need for Corrosion Engineering Team (driven by Enterprise risk). Essentially, Corrosion Engineering team wants an additional post-ILI procedure to flag pipelines for prevention and mitigatio measures according to additional critieria:
- Any time corrosion deeper than 50% of wall thickness is found on ILI run
- Whenever majority of corrosion occurs on one section of pipe. This has been defined as volumetric wall loss 2 standard deviations above the mean.
- When either of the above conditions are true, the CE team will gather the relevant cathodic protection data and set a meeting with Corrosion Engineering Superivsor and Corrosion Field Services Supervisor or their representatives.

The challenge lies in how to define "section of pipe" and subsequently the sample population.
- Will have to look at the results for different definitions of "section of pipe" and how that changes things.
